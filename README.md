### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/The-Accidental-Game-Devs/menu_listing_website.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd menu_listing_website
    ```
3.  **Create a Python virtual environment (recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv # For Windows
    python3 -m venv .venv  # For Linux/macOS
    ```
4.  **Activate the virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate # For Linux/macOS
    .venv\Scripts\activate # For Windows
    ```
5.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
6.  **Create a `.env` file**:
    This file will store your environment variables, including sensitive data like your `SECRET_KEY`.
    ```bash
    nano .env  # For Linux/macOS, or use any text editor
    ```
7.  **Add your Django `SECRET_KEY`**:
    Paste the following line into your `.env` file. **Replace `YourStrongUniqueSecretKey` with a truly unique and complex key.**
    ```bash
    SECRET_KEY='YourStrongUniqueSecretKey'
    ```
    You can generate a strong key using Python:
    ```bash
    python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe())"
    ```
    **Important**: Never commit your `.env` file or actual `SECRET_KEY` to version control!
8.  **Apply database migrations**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
9.  **Create a superuser (for admin access)**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
    Follow the prompts to enter your desired username, email, and password.
10. **Run the development server locally**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    You can now access the website at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` and the admin panel at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`.
